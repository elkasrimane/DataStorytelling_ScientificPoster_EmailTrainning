It can be difficult to organise and prioritise workload because emails demand answers to the content immediately.  This may involve additional work offline before answering.  Emails also keep coming all day long which has the effect of 'feeding the machine' rather than anything else.  As a manager I try not to request everything by email which can be an easy lazy option.,12,Quick and efficient.

It is also good to email work home if there is extra work that needs to be done.  Emails can support people,1,5,1,5,2,180,40,20,1,3,1,"I try hard to use emails supportively and keep my requests for work down to a minimum.

An email is only as effective as the person's intention.  Some emails contain such long and convoluted content that it needs to be read over and over again and still not understood.

It can actually make communication porrer by relying too heavily on it!  I used to work in a large secondary school 10 years ago where we did not use email & communication was just as effective.  we were not hampered by the lack of email which is interesting.
